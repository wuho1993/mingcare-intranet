# ðŸ”§ Hostinger Deployment Troubleshooting

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "I can't find File Manager in Hostinger"
**Solution:**
- Look for "Website" â†’ "File Manager" 
- Or "Hosting" â†’ "File Manager"
- Or "Files" in the main dashboard

### Issue 2: "I don't see a terminal/console"
**Solution:**
- Look for "SSH Access" or "Terminal"
- Or try "Advanced" â†’ "SSH Access"
- Alternative: Contact Hostinger support to enable Node.js

### Issue 3: "Upload failed or ZIP won't extract"
**Solution:**
- Try uploading files one by one:
  1. Upload `.next` folder first (most important)
  2. Upload `public` folder
  3. Upload `package.json`, `next.config.js`, `.env.local`

### Issue 4: "Still getting /mingcare-intranet/ errors"
**Solution:**
- Make sure you deleted ALL old files first
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Wait 5-10 minutes for changes to propagate

### Issue 5: "npm commands don't work"
**Solution:**
- Hostinger might not have Node.js enabled
- Contact Hostinger support to enable Node.js hosting
- Or check if they have a "Node.js" section in control panel

### Issue 6: "Website shows different errors now"
**Good news!** This means the upload worked. New errors are usually:
- Missing environment variables
- Database connection issues
- These are easier to fix

## ðŸ“ž Getting Help

### From Hostinger:
- Use their live chat support
- Ask: "How do I deploy a Next.js application?"
- Mention: "I need Node.js enabled for my domain"

### From Me:
- Send me screenshots of:
  - Hostinger file manager showing your files
  - Browser console errors
  - Any error messages you see

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Verification Commands

If you get terminal access, run these to verify:
```bash
# Check if files are there
ls -la

# Should see: .next, public, package.json, next.config.js

# Check Node.js version
node --version

# Should be 18+ or 20+

# Install and start
npm install
npm start
```

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips
1. **Don't panic** - the files are correct, it's just about getting them in the right place
2. **Take screenshots** - visual confirmation helps a lot
3. **One step at a time** - don't try to do everything at once
4. **Clear cache** - browsers love to cache old broken versions
