URGENT - Auth Service Down for 8+ Hours - Healthcare Emergency

Subject: CRITICAL - Persistent Auth Template Fatal Error - Healthcare System Emergency

Dear Supabase Support Team,

I have a CRITICAL authentication service outage that has persisted for over 8 hours, affecting a healthcare management system.

TIMELINE SUMMARY:
- Service was working normally until 02:33:45 UTC
- Fatal template errors started at 03:28:01 UTC  
- Latest error: 11:55:10 UTC (Event ID: 35cc565e-863b-4448-9b8f-b56c935a4d16)
- TOTAL DOWNTIME: 8+ hours and counting

CONFIRMED PATTERN:
- Recurring fatal error: "Failed to load configuration: template: :1: function \"code\" not defined"
- All /auth/v1/* endpoints return 503 Service Unavailable
- Database services remain fully operational
- GoTrue service starts but immediately crashes on template parsing

BUSINESS IMPACT:
- Healthcare management system completely inaccessible  
- 184 healthcare staff cannot access patient management
- 2,221 billing records inaccessible
- Critical patient care coordination completely halted
- Revenue loss accumulating every hour

TROUBLESHOOTING COMPLETED:
✅ Reset all authentication providers to default
✅ Disabled phone/SMS authentication completely  
✅ Rotated all API keys and database credentials
✅ Verified site URLs and JWT settings
✅ Attempted template reset multiple times
✅ Waited for multiple service restart cycles (8+ hours)
✅ Confirmed database and other services operational

ROOT CAUSE:
Authentication service configuration template contains undefined "code" function reference that prevents service startup. This appears to be a backend template corruption that cannot be resolved through standard user dashboard operations.

ESCALATION REQUEST:
This requires immediate backend engineering intervention to:
1. Manually inspect and fix the corrupted auth template configuration
2. Remove or define the undefined "code" function reference  
3. Restart the authentication service
4. Verify service restoration

URGENCY JUSTIFICATION:
- Healthcare business operations completely halted for 8+ hours
- Patient care coordination severely impacted
- Standard troubleshooting cannot resolve backend template corruption
- Multiple event IDs confirm persistent infrastructure issue
- Business loss accumulating exponentially

Please escalate to your engineering team immediately for manual template repair.

This is a confirmed backend infrastructure issue requiring engineering team intervention.

Thank you for URGENT resolution.
